      <h1 className="main-heading">SDG 2: Zero Hunger</h1>
      <strong>Goal</strong>
      <p>
        End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote
        sustainable agriculture.
      </p>

      <strong>Importance and Scope</strong>
      <p>
        SDG 2, "Zero Hunger," aims to end hunger, achieve food security, and
        improve nutrition, while promoting sustainable agriculture. This goal
        recognizes the need to ensure that all people have access to sufficient,
        safe, and nutritious food all year round, especially the poor and
        vulnerable, including infants. It also emphasizes the importance of
        sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices
        that increase productivity and production, help maintain ecosystems, and
        strengthen the capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme
        weather, drought, flooding, and other disasters.
      </p>

      <strong>Key Targets and Indicators</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>End Hunger:</strong> Ensure access by all people, in
          particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including
          infants, to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food all year round.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>End All Forms of Malnutrition:</strong> By 2025, achieve
          internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children
          under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent
          girls, pregnant and lactating women, and older persons.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Double Agricultural Productivity:</strong> Ensure sustainable
          food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices
          that increase productivity and production, help maintain ecosystems,
          strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, and
          progressively improve land and soil quality.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maintain Genetic Diversity:</strong> Maintain the genetic
          diversity of seeds, cultivated plants, and farmed and domesticated
          animals and their related wild species, including through soundly
          managed and diversified seed and plant banks at national, regional,
          and international levels.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Invest in Rural Infrastructure:</strong> Increase investment,
          including through enhanced international cooperation, in rural
          infrastructure, agricultural research and extension services,
          technology development, and plant and livestock gene banks to enhance
          agricultural productive capacity in developing countries, particularly
          in least developed countries.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Correct Trade Distortions:</strong> Correct and prevent trade
          restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets, including
          through the parallel elimination of all forms of agricultural export
          subsidies and all export measures with equivalent effect, in
          accordance with the mandate of the Doha Development Round.

      <strong>Why It Matters</strong>
      <p>
        Achieving SDG 2 is essential for sustainable development because hunger
        and malnutrition are significant barriers to economic and social
        progress. Food insecurity affects health, education, and livelihoods,
        and can lead to cycles of poverty and inequality. Ensuring food security
        and promoting sustainable agriculture are crucial for improving
        nutrition, reducing health disparities, and supporting resilient
        communities.
      </p>

      <strong>Implementation and Progress</strong>
      <p>
        Progress towards SDG 2 is monitored through indicators such as the
        prevalence of undernourishment, the prevalence of stunting and wasting
        in children under 5 years of age, and the productivity and income of
        small-scale food producers. Countries and international organizations
        work together to implement policies and programs that promote food
        security, sustainable agriculture, and resilient food systems.

      <strong>Global Efforts and Collaboration</strong>
      <p>
        Achieving SDG 2 requires collaborative efforts at local, national, and
        global levels. It involves investing in agriculture, supporting
        smallholder farmers, improving access to markets, and enhancing food
        production systems. Global partnerships, international cooperation, and
        innovative solutions are essential for addressing the complex challenges
        of hunger, food security, and sustainable agriculture.
      </p>

      <strong>Conclusion</strong>
      <p>
        SDG 2 reflects a commitment to ending hunger, achieving food security,
        and promoting sustainable agriculture. It underscores the importance of
        ensuring access to nutritious food for all, particularly the poor and
        vulnerable, and highlights the need for sustainable and resilient
        agricultural practices. By addressing the root causes of hunger and food
        insecurity, SDG 2 aims to create a world where everyone has the
        opportunity to lead a healthy and productive life.
