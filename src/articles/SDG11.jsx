      <strong>Importance and Scope</strong>
      <p>
        SDG 11, "Sustainable Cities and Communities," aims to make cities and
        human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. This goal
        addresses the need for urban environments that support the well-being of
        their inhabitants and reduce the environmental impact of urbanization.
        It encompasses a broad range of issues related to urban development,
        including housing, transportation, and the management of urban growth.
      </p>

      <strong>Key Targets and Indicators</strong>

      <strong>Why It Matters</strong>
      <p>
        Achieving SDG 11 is crucial for sustainable development because cities
        are central to economic growth, social development, and environmental
        sustainability. Urban areas are home to more than half of the worlds
        population and are key drivers of economic activity. Ensuring that
        cities and communities are inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable
        is essential for improving the quality of life for urban residents and
        addressing the challenges of rapid urbanization.
      </p>

      <strong>Implementation and Progress</strong>
      <p>
        Progress towards SDG 11 is monitored through indicators such as the
        proportion of the population living in slums, the availability of public
        transportation, and the quality of urban green spaces. Countries and
        international organizations collaborate to implement policies and
        programs that promote sustainable urban development, enhance resilience,
        and improve the quality of life in cities and communities.
