      <h1 className="main-heading">SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation</h1>
      <strong>Goal</strong>
      <p>
        Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation
        for all.
      </p>

      <strong>Importance and Scope</strong>
      <p>
        SDG 6, "Clean Water and Sanitation," aims to ensure availability and
        sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. This goal
        recognizes the importance of water and sanitation as essential for human
        health, well-being, and sustainable development. It encompasses a wide
        range of issues, including access to safe drinking water, sanitation,
        hygiene, water quality, and water resource management.
      </p>

      <strong>Key Targets and Indicators</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Universal Access to Safe Drinking Water:</strong> By 2030,
          achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking
          water for all.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Access to Adequate Sanitation and Hygiene:</strong> By 2030,
          achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for
          all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of
          women and girls and those in vulnerable situations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improve Water Quality:</strong> By 2030, improve water quality
          by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping, and minimizing the release
          of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of
          untreated wastewater, and substantially increasing recycling and safe
          reuse globally.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Increase Water-Use Efficiency:</strong> By 2030, substantially
          increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure
          sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water
          scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from
          water scarcity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Implement Integrated Water Resources Management:</strong> By
          2030, implement integrated water resources management at all levels,
          including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Protect and Restore Water-Related Ecosystems:</strong> By
          2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including
          mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers, and lakes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Expand International Cooperation and Capacity-Building:
          </strong>{" "}
          By 2030, expand international cooperation and capacity-building
          support to developing countries in water- and sanitation-related
          activities and programs, including water harvesting, desalination,
          water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling, and reuse
          technologies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Support and Strengthen Local Participation:</strong> Support
          and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving
          water and sanitation management.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <strong>Why It Matters</strong>
      <p>
        Achieving SDG 6 is crucial for sustainable development because access to
        clean water and sanitation is essential for human health, dignity, and
        economic development. Water and sanitation are fundamental to poverty
        reduction, health, food security, gender equality, and ecosystem
        sustainability. Ensuring access to these services can prevent diseases,
        improve quality of life, and promote social and economic development.
      </p>

      <strong>Implementation and Progress</strong>
      <p>
        Progress towards SDG 6 is monitored through indicators such as access to
        safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, and hygiene services, water
        quality, and the implementation of integrated water resources
        management. Countries and international organizations collaborate to
        implement policies and programs that promote sustainable water and
        sanitation management, improve water quality, and ensure access to these
        essential services for all.

      <strong>Global Efforts and Collaboration</strong>
      <p>
        Achieving SDG 6 requires coordinated efforts at local, national, and
        global levels. It involves investing in water and sanitation
        infrastructure, improving water quality, managing water resources
        sustainably, and promoting hygiene practices. Global partnerships,
        international cooperation, and funding for water and sanitation
        initiatives are essential for addressing global water and sanitation
        challenges and achieving the goal of clean water and sanitation for all.
      </p>

      <strong>Conclusion</strong>
      <p>
        SDG 6 reflects a commitment to ensuring the availability and sustainable
        management of water and sanitation for all. It underscores the
        importance of water and sanitation as essential for human health,
        well-being, and sustainable development. By addressing the root causes
        of water and sanitation disparities and promoting access to clean water
        and sanitation services, SDG 6 aims to create a world where everyone has
        the opportunity to live a healthy, dignified, and productive life.
