      <h1 className="main-heading">SDG 1: No Poverty</h1>
      <strong>Goal</strong>
      <p>End poverty in all its forms everywhere.</p>

      <strong>Importance and Scope</strong>
      <p>
        SDG 1, "No Poverty," aims to eradicate poverty in all its dimensions
        globally. This goal recognizes that poverty is more than just a lack of
        income; it includes lack of access to basic resources such as education,
        healthcare, clean water, and sanitation. Poverty affects billions of
        people worldwide, perpetuating cycles of deprivation and hindering
        sustainable development.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Eradicating Extreme Poverty:</strong> Targeted at lifting
          people living on less than $1.25 a day (extreme poverty) out of
          deprivation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reducing Overall Poverty:</strong> Targeted at reducing by

          various sources, including development cooperation, to support poverty
          eradication efforts, especially in least developed countries.

      <strong>Why It Matters</strong>
      <p>
        Achieving SDG 1 is crucial for sustainable development because poverty
        undermines economic growth, social cohesion, and environmental
        sustainability. Poverty reduction contributes to improving health
        outcomes, increasing access to education, promoting gender equality, and
        fostering inclusive economic growth.
      </p>

      <strong>Implementation and Progress</strong>
      <p>
        Progress towards SDG 1 is monitored through indicators such as the
        proportion of the population living below the national poverty line,
        access to social protection systems, and coverage of essential services.
        Countries and international organizations collaborate to implement
        policies and programs that prioritize poverty reduction and social
        inclusion.

      <strong>Global Efforts and Collaboration</strong>
      <p>
        Achieving SDG 1 requires coordinated efforts at local, national, and
        global levels. It involves policy reforms, investment in social
        infrastructure, promotion of inclusive economic growth, and empowerment
        of marginalized communities. Global partnerships, development
        assistance, and capacity-building initiatives play a crucial role in
        supporting countries to achieve poverty eradication targets.
      </p>

      <strong>Conclusion</strong>
      <p>
        SDG 1 reflects a commitment to ending poverty in all its forms and
        dimensions by addressing its root causes and promoting sustainable
        development. It underscores the interconnectedness of poverty with other
        global challenges and emphasizes the need for comprehensive and
        inclusive approaches to ensure that no one is left behind in the journey
        towards a more equitable and prosperous world.
