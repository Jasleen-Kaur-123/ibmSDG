      <h1 className="main-heading">SDG 14: Life Below Water</h1>
      <strong>Goal</strong>
      <p>
        Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for
        sustainable development.
      </p>

      <strong>Importance and Scope</strong>
      <p>
        SDG 14, "Life Below Water," focuses on the conservation and sustainable
        use of the oceans, seas, and marine resources. Oceans cover over 70% of
        the Earths surface and are vital for the planet’s health and human
        well-being. They provide food, regulate the climate, and support diverse
        ecosystems. This goal addresses the need to protect marine environments,
        manage fisheries sustainably, and reduce marine pollution.
      </p>

      <strong>Key Targets and Indicators</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Reduce Marine Pollution:</strong> By 2025, prevent and
          significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, particularly from
          land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Protect Marine Ecosystems:</strong> Sustainably manage and
          protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse
          impacts, strengthen their resilience, and take action for their
          restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>End Overfishing:</strong> End overfishing, illegal,
          unreported, and unregulated fishing, and destructive fishing
          practices, and implement science-based management plans in order to
          restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Increase Scientific Knowledge and Research:</strong> Increase
          scientific knowledge, develop research capacity, and transfer marine
          technology to improve ocean health and enhance the contribution of
          marine biodiversity to the development of developing countries.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Increase the Economic Benefits from Sustainable Marine Resources:
          </strong>{" "}
          Increase the economic benefits to Small Island Developing States and
          least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine
          resources, including through sustainable fisheries, aquaculture, and
          tourism.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prohibit Certain Types of Fishing Practices:</strong> Prohibit
          certain forms of fishing that have the potential to harm marine
          biodiversity and ecosystems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Protect the High Seas:</strong> Protect and restore the health
          of the high seas through international cooperation and agreements to
          regulate and manage activities in these areas.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Address Ocean Acidification:</strong> Minimize and address the
          impacts of ocean acidification, including through scientific research
          and the development of mitigation and adaptation strategies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Promote Ocean Conservation:</strong> Promote international
          partnerships to support ocean conservation and address challenges
          related to marine pollution, biodiversity loss, and sustainable
          resource use.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enhance Marine Spatial Planning:</strong> Enhance marine
          spatial planning and integrated management of marine resources to
          ensure sustainable use and conservation of marine environments.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <strong>Why It Matters</strong>
      <p>
        SDG 14 is crucial for ensuring the health and sustainability of our
        oceans, which are integral to life on Earth. Oceans provide essential
        services such as food, climate regulation, and habitat for marine life.
        Protecting marine environments and resources is vital for maintaining
        biodiversity, supporting livelihoods, and ensuring that future
        generations can enjoy the benefits of healthy oceans.
      </p>

      <strong>Implementation and Progress</strong>
      <p>
        Progress towards SDG 14 is monitored through indicators related to
        marine pollution levels, the status of marine ecosystems, and the
        effectiveness of fisheries management. Efforts to achieve this goal
        involve international cooperation, policy development, and scientific
        research to address challenges in marine conservation and sustainable
        resource use.

      <strong>Global Efforts and Collaboration</strong>
      <p>
        Achieving SDG 14 requires global collaboration to manage and protect the
        worlds oceans. International agreements, such as the United Nations
        Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Global Ocean Treaty,
        provide frameworks for countries to work together on ocean conservation,
        sustainable fisheries, and marine biodiversity protection.
      </p>

      <strong>Conclusion</strong>
      <p>
        SDG 14 represents a global commitment to conserving and sustainably
        using the oceans, seas, and marine resources. By addressing issues such
        as marine pollution, overfishing, and ocean acidification, SDG 14 aims
        to protect marine environments, support marine biodiversity, and promote
        sustainable development for future generations.
