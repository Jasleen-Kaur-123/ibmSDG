      <strong>Why It Matters</strong>
      <p>
        Achieving SDG 3 is crucial for sustainable development because good
        health and well-being are essential for individuals to lead productive
        and fulfilling lives. Health is interconnected with many other goals,
        including education, poverty reduction, gender equality, and economic
        growth. Improving health outcomes can lead to a more prosperous and
        equitable society, reducing inequalities and promoting social and
        economic development.
      </p>

      <strong>Implementation and Progress</strong>
      <p>
        Progress towards SDG 3 is monitored through indicators such as the
        maternal mortality ratio, under-5 mortality rate, incidence of
        communicable and non-communicable diseases, and coverage of essential
        health services. Countries and international organizations collaborate
        to implement policies and programs that promote health, prevent disease,
        and ensure access to quality healthcare for all.
