      <strong>Why It Matters</strong>
      <p>
        Achieving SDG 7 is crucial for sustainable development because access to
        affordable and clean energy is essential for economic development,
        social progress, and environmental protection. Energy is vital for
        various aspects of life, including healthcare, education,
        transportation, and industry. Ensuring access to sustainable energy can
        reduce poverty, improve health, create jobs, and mitigate climate change
        by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
      </p>

      <strong>Implementation and Progress</strong>
      <p>
        Progress towards SDG 7 is monitored through indicators such as access to
        electricity, the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix, and
        improvements in energy efficiency. Countries and international
        organizations collaborate to implement policies and programs that
        promote access to sustainable energy, increase renewable energy
        capacity, and improve energy efficiency.
